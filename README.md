# VAPT_Report

This repository showcases my journey in learning to write professional **Penetration Testing (Pentest) Reports**, aligned with industry standards like **OWASP**. The project covers everything from setting up tools and environments to conducting vulnerability assessments and documenting findings in a structured report.

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the skills required to produce a professional pentest report, including:
- Setting up and configuring **Greenbone OpenVAS** for vulnerability scanning.
- Creating a secure testing environment with **Metasploitable**.
- Performing comprehensive vulnerability assessments and risk calculations.
- Writing detailed and actionable pentest reports.

The project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, focusing on vulnerability identification, risk assessment, and mapping the potential damage of exploitation.

## Purpose
The primary goals of this project are:
- To learn and demonstrate **how to write a pentest report that adheres to OWASP guidelines**.
- To understand the importance of **vulnerability assessment and management**.
- To evaluate the likelihood of vulnerabilities being exploited and assess their impact through controlled penetration tests.
- To showcase a skill set highly valued in the cybersecurity industry.


## Key Report Highlights
- **Risk Levels**: Detailed categorization of vulnerabilities into High, Medium, and Low risks.
- **OWASP Alignment**: Testing and reporting aligned with OWASP principles.
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear recommendations for mitigating identified risks.
- **Professional Formatting**: Structured reports resembling industry-grade deliverables.
